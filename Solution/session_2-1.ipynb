    "- Linear regression is a technique for building models that can be trained on known data to make predictions for unknown data\n",
    "- 'Training' comes down to minimizing the sample 'Residual Sum of Squares' (RSS) with respect to the model parameters $\\beta$\n",
    "- The RSS function can be minimized analytically (solve $\\nabla_{\\vec{\\beta}}RSS=0$), or numerically, using for instance gradient descent\n",
    "- The `scikit-learn` Python package can be used to automatically create, train, and make predictions from models\n",
    "- We found that our model was able to make predictions on the data set it trained on (training set) that were better than its predictions on new data it didn't optimize for (test set)\n",
    "- This problem is known as * overfitting *, and making models that are more generalizable to new data is a massively important topic in machine learning\n",
